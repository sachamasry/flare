# Flare

Flare is an Elixir publishing platform based on Beacon CMS.

## Overview

Beacon CMS is still in very early-stage development, however, the idea of an Elixir-based content 
management system is extremely appealing. The ability to rely on the same templating system already
in use in web applications, with the entirety of the Elixir language and the Phoenix [LiveView] system 
available underneath it, opens up an extraordinary amount of power and flexibility.

## Installation

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
